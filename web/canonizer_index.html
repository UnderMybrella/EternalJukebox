**The Autocanonizer** takes your favorite song and turns it into a musical canon by playing the song against a varying, time-offset copy of itself. The best way to understand exactly what this does is to listen to this autocanonized version of Adele's [Someone like you](canonizer_go.html?id=4kflIGfjdZJW4ot2ioixTB). After that, go and [Pick a song](canonizer_search.html) to listen to other autocanonized songs.
